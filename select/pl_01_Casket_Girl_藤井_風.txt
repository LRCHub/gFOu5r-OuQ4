Oh wake up bro she'll come alive
(u better watch out baby)
(u better watch out baby)
Oh she's about to wreck your life
(u better watch out baby)
(u better watch out buddy)
I just wanted to be free
n be happy endlessly
Something always drags me down
Wanna run away but I can't
Casket girl
You came to lay my body down
(There's nothing you can do, you're already
dead)
Fast or slow, just so you know
Them gorgeous eyes
Are my demise
Casket girl
You came to make me go insane
(How can we not survive, it's such a shame)
Use me up
Can't get enough of all her lies
It can't be right
Oh
Casket girl
Oh wake up bro it's just a dream
(u better watch out baby)
(u better watch out baby)
Life is a game, we play it as a team
(we gotta make it baby)
(we gotta make it till the end)
Just when I see the sunrise
n lie around at midnight
You'll come back at any time
I'll be crying, fighting for my life
Casket girl
You came to lay my body down
(There's nothing you can do, you're already
dead)
Fast or slow, just so you know
Them gorgeous eyes
Are my demise
Casket girl
You came to make me go insane
(How can we not survive, it's such a shame)
Use me up
Can't get enough of all her lies
It can't be right
There's gotta be a way to make it better
Try a little love and grow together
Woooa woooa
'Nough of delusion
Let's get out of the whole and
Find a way to make it better
Try a little love yourself together
Woooa woooa
High time for freedom
Why don't we both come outta Casket girl
Casket girl we got some kind of freedom
Casket girl we got some kind of freedom
Casket girl we got some kind of freedom
How about we both come outta Casket girl
